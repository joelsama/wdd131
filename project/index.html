      <p>We are a small-batch coffee roasting company based in the heart of the city, dedicated to sourcing ethically grown beans and roasting them to perfection. What started as a weekend hobby turned into a community-driven mission to deliver rich, flavorful coffee with integrity.</p>
      <p>Every batch we roast is crafted with attention to detail, love for the bean, and respect for the farmers who grow them. Our mission? To brew better mornings — one cup at a time.</p>
